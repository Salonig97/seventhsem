ES concepts
Node
	A single server that runs Easticsearch, stores your data
Cluster
	A collection of one or more nodes that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capablities across all nodes
Indes
	A cluster can have multiple indexes, eg buyer index, seller indes
Type	
	A index can have one or more typs(share same fields), semantics are upto the user
Document
 	Nasic unit of imformation that can be indexed
Shards
	Horizontal partitions of the index so that the index can scale beyond capacity of one node
Replicas	
	Shards can be replicated for fault tolerance and supporting large query volume

Build search engine for coep.org.in



Teams of 2-4
Crawl
	Use Nutch, crawl O(100) pages for experimentations
Index
	Use Elasticsearch
Tune relevance
	Try different field configurations boosting etc
Deploy
	Production installation with the right cluster size(with redundany)
	Handle updates
Integrate
	One of the projectss (with full crawl updates and good relevance) , can be integrated with coep.org.in
